# Neural Network for MNIST Classification

This project demonstrates the use of a custom-built Neural Network (NN) to classify hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset. 

## Project Structure

The main script (`main.py`) first loads the MNIST data, prepares it for training, and then trains a neural network model on it. It allows you to specify the number of hidden layers and neurons, batch size, number of training epochs, learning rate, and loss function to use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- PyTorch (latest version)
- MNIST dataset package
- Matplotlib (latest version)
- Numpy (latest version)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages listed in the Requirements section.
3. Run the script using Python 3.8 or later.

You can adjust the simulation settings such as number of epochs, batch size, number of neurons in each hidden layer, loss function, and learning rate according to your requirements.

## Output

The script will display the training and testing accuracy for each epoch and will generate two plots:
1. The loss function per batch for the latest epoch.
2. The accuracy per epoch for both the training and test data.

At the end of the training process, the total training time is also displayed.

## Notes

This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the use of a neural network model for image classification tasks.
